# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Welcome to my image classification project using CNNs! This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images into various categories. The CNN architecture used here is designed to effectively learn hierarchical features from images for accurate classification.
